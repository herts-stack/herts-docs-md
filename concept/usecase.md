* RPC services such as gRPC, used by Microservices. Services basically implemented only in **Java** .
* Systems that require both HTTP(REST) and gRPC APIs.
  * Herts makes it easy to implement a proxy server.
* Required Bi-directional real-time communication.
  * Herts makes it easy to load balance and perform real-time processing


## Example systems
* Between Robotics and Server for real time communication.
* Game server for real time communication.
* All cases that require high-speed and real-time processing on the internal server
